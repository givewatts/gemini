## Gemini/Smolnet Software
### Clients

> Lagrange is a GUI client for browsing Geminispace. It offers modern conveniences familiar from web browsers, such as smooth scrolling, inline image viewing, multiple tabs, visual themes, Unicode fonts, bookmarks, history, and page outlines.

    🛈 Unquestionably the best overall client for browsing much of the smolnet, especially Gemini Cross-platform, beautiful, feature-rich, and supports multiple other protocols like Spartan and Gopher. 

### Servers
=> gemini://qwertqwefsday.eu/agate.gmi Agate

> Agate is a server for the Gemini network protocol, built with the Rust programming language. Agate has very few features, and can only serve static files. It uses async I/O, and should be quite efficient even when running on low-end hardware and serving many concurrent requests.
