    🛈 Unquestionably the best overall client for browsing much of the smolnet, especially Gemini Cross-platform, beautiful, feature-rich, and supports multiple other protocols like Spartan and Gopher. 

### Servers
=> gemini://qwertqwefsday.eu/agate.gmi Agate
> Agate is a server for the Gemini network protocol, built with the Rust programming language. Agate has very few features, and can only serve static files. It uses async I/O, and should be quite efficient even when running on low-end hardware and serving many concurrent requests.
