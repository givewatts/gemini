# Hotline & KDX

Hotline (HL) and KDX are client/server software for file sharing, chat, private messaging, message boards, as well as other features depending on software and build. Both were most popular in the late 90s-early 00s, KDX being more recently developed with a greater feature set.

It's easiest to think of Hotline & KDX as 'modern' GUI BBS. Hotline, in specific, was originally developed for Mac, with Win versions soon being released. Versions and third-party clients for other OS are also available in various stages of completeness. KDX runs of both platforms as well.

Some old servers still exist, and a small group of users is attempting to revive the protocols with new servers and content.
