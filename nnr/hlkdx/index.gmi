# Hotline & KDX

Hotline (HL) and KDX are client/server communication software suites with file sharing, chat, private messaging, message boards, as well as other features depending on software and build. Both were most popular in the late 90s-early 00s, KDX being more recently developed with a greater feature set. Versions of both (includind third party) still work on multiple platforms. They are essentially BBSes for the GUI era. 

Foth both, Some old servers still exist, and a small group of users are attempting to revive the protocols with new servers and content.
