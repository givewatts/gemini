# ☸️ Net Nostalgia Refugees (NNR) ☸️
## GiveEmWatts's home on Geminispace and Spartan
```
⏳ Last update (approx): February 12, 2023

To all interested in net nostalgia, the smolnet, 90s/oldweb aesthetic, and any interesting unrelated topics:
``` Welcome! banner
    ╔════════════╗
    ║▀▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▀║
    ║            ║
    ║  Welcome!  ║
    ║            ║
    ║▄▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▄║
    ╚════════════╝
```

Although themed, this also serves as my personal capsule, whatever that may entail.
