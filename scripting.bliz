# Welcome to Bliz!

Bliz is running and has transformed this .bliz script into a presentable gemtext in real time.

Here are some examples of what you can do with the power of Bliz.

The time is %$b_current_time.

There are %$b_words words in this document, not counting script data.

Here is a directory listing:

```
% ls -lpB (dirname $blizfile)
```

Some browsers support ANSI palettes in preformatted text:

```
% set_color 000 -b 85f264
Take a walk through the green grass.
```
